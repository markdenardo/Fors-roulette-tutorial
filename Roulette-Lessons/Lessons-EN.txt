*Roulette* by $Link *Fors*<https://fors.fm> 

Vivid memories of transistors and warm plastic from a faraway place were distilled into a single voice of what we loved most. Lode is a monophonic bass synthesizer inspired by our most beloved vintage pieces; instruments that were greater than the sum of their parts and full of charm.

With simplicity there is a great reward in exploring inherent boundaries and making the most out of them. Something that may seem uncomplicated at first often reveals a depth in its subtleties and rich character.

Lode is a collection of subtleties that we cherish, a humble but strong bass synth that is a joy to use.

The sequencer sends note and rhythm data to the synth engine for generating melodies. It is entirely polymetric and asymmetric.

*Pitch, Transposition & Trig*

The sequencer starts with 'Pitch' for its base note. It then goes through two transposition stages and is finally sent as a note by Trig.

-> *Pitch*

Pitch is a list of pitches that can have a length of up to 16 values set by Len. In the Pitch section, you can also set a Tonic and a Scale which will quantize all notes as desired.

-> *Transpose*

Transpose is a list of intervals in semitones that affects the incoming notes in succession. The intervals are changed by typing into the Transpose text fields. 

For example; "0 5 7" is a pattern length of 3 wherein 0 will have no effect, 5 is a perfect fourth and 7 is a perfect fifth. Each number needs a space in between. 

Div divides the incoming clock and will repeat each number according to the division.

-> *Trigs*

Trigs sends out the current pitch, a result of Pitch + 1st Transp + 2nd Transp. Reset deter- mines the length of the Trig pattern.

-> *Velocity*

The Velocity lane can be used like transpose to introduce different velocities for the trigs.

*Polymeters & Asymmetry*

As mentioned previously, the sequencer is always polymetric and also asymmetric. This means that the pitch information is detached from the trig events. This means you can create complex sequences that evolve over time depending on the numerical relationships of the dif- ferent sequence lengths and how they create a continually rotating pattern. You could see it as an algorithmic arpeggiator, and can take a while to fully grasp. We highly recommend setting a Scale.

-> *Monometric*

The sequences have the same length
